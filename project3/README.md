Project Description:

1. Implemented Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (NNA) to compute the journey for Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).

2. Implemented Greedy Edge Algorithm (GEA) to compute the journey for Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).

3. Implemented an order crossover (in Genetic Programming) of two given journeys of same size.

4. Implemented a mutation (in Genetic Programming) by reversing some part of the given journey to generate a new journey.

5. Constructed a union graph of two given journeys, and generated several edges from a starting vertex via NNA in the union graph. After selecting the above edges, generated the remaining edges via NNA in the full original graph.
