# Algorithms_with_Applications
This repo includes my projects for CS260P 2020 Winter at UCI.

Usage:
/app: the C++ source code for each project
/gtest: write unit tests for use with a unit testing framework called Google Test
/exp: write short programs that experiment with features of the larger program youâ€™re building

In the Linux/Unix environment:

Build the program
From the "~/projects/proj0" directory, enter the command: ./build

Run the program: ./run

Google test: ./run gtest

Gather files: ./gather
The gather script will gather all of the files in your app, exp and gtest directories and no others, so be sure that anything you want to submit is in the app, exp, or guest directories before running it. Prepare a file called projectX.tar.gz
